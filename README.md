# pattern-chatterbot
A very primitive bot based on pattern matching.
This bot learns to talk from the user itself, so the way you talk is going to reflect after using it a few times. There is a default file available so that users don't have to work from the scratch.

Instruction to run bot:

Download the python file(finalbotcode.py) and the bot-data(botdata.dat). Make sure to keep both in a same folder.
Run the python file, and there are some restrictions like don't use puctuations or texting language and use only lower case text. or else it will keep repeting your statements.
Even after following these instructions, if the bot repeats your statement, it means this type of statement is new for him, in this case you have to answer it in a way you would do to a normal person, i.e. If feed a new statement to it:
USER: who is sachin
BOT: who is sachin
USER: he is the god of cricket.
